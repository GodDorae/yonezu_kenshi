## About the project

Since I am a big fan of Yonezu Kenshi who is a famous singer in Japan,  
I decided to make a fanpage of him.  
Also, by completing this fanpage, I tried to review basic features of  
HTML, CSS, and JS. (Especially, CSS)

By using CSS and JS, I tried to make an interactive page.  
Users can enjoy contents of the page by hovering and clicking the page elements.  
Media query is adapted so you can enjoy this page both on phone or PC.  
However, I recommend users to enjoy this page on PC  
in order to fully experience various animations and features.

This page is made up of 6 sections.

### Header
Header is always fixed on the top of the screen.  
There are 3 components in the header.  
When one of them is hovered, a line is drawn under the component.  
When one of them is clicked, user can move to the specific section that component indicates.  

### Title
Title includes name of Yonezu Kenshi written in both Chinese and English.  
After each letter of the name in Chinese comes out,  
full name in English comes out below it.  
Both names are displayed with a animation.

### Introduction of Yonezu Kenshi
This section contains gallery and brief introduction of Yonezu Kenshi.  
When user hovers an image of the gallery,  
the image turns from black-and-white to full-color.  
It is also placed in front of other images and gets bigger.

### Discography
This section has all the regular albums Yonezu Kenshi has released.  
When user hovers an album cover image, the image is flipped and  
information about the album is displayed.  
(ex. album no., album name, release date)  
Also user can click the 'Tracklist' button, and after the click,  
tracklist of the album is shown with a modal window.

### Editor's pick
In this section, I chose 5 favorite songs of Yonezu Kenshi.  
There are some information about the song  
such as my rank, title, and highlight of the song.  
User can slide left and right to see other songs.  

### Footer
Footer contains several SNS links of Yonezu Kenshi and my github address.
