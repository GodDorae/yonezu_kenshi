## About the project

Since I am a big fan of Yonezu Kenshi who is a famous singer in Japan,  
I decided to make a fanpage of him.  
Also, by completing this fanpage, I tried to review basic features of  
HTML, CSS, and JS. (Especially, CSS)

By using CSS and JS, I tried to make an interactive page.  
Users can enjoy contents of the page by hovering and clicking the page elements.  
Media query is adapted so you can enjoy this page both on phone or PC.  
However, I recommend users to enjoy this page on PC  
in order to fully experience various animations and features.

This page is made up of 6 sections.

### Header
Header is always fixed on the top of the screen.  
There are 3 components in the header.  
When one of them is hovered, a line is drawn under the component.  
When one of them is clicked, user can move to the specific section that component indicates.  

### Title
Title includes name of Yonezu Kenshi written in both Chinese and English.  
After each letter of the name in Chinese comes out,  
full name in English comes out below it.  
Both names are displayed with a animation.
